This repository is a collection of coding challenges sourced from the renowned website Project Euler solved by Farhan Anjum. Project Euler offers a series of challenging mathematical and computer programming problems designed to stretch your problem-solving skills. While mathematical insights are valuable, the real magic happens when you combine them with your programming prowess.
These problems are specifically solved using Javascript.</p>

<h2>About Project Euler</h2> <img src="https://projecteuler.net/images/clipart/euler_portrait.png">
<p>Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.

The motivation for starting Project Euler, and its continuation, is to provide a platform for the inquiring mind to delve into unfamiliar areas and learn new concepts in a fun and recreational context.</p>
